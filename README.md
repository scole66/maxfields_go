# Maxfields_go

This is a small go project to do maxfield calculations for Ingress.
It's based on work done by @jpeterbaker, but altered to work in the Go language (because I'm trying to learn it),
and using the algorithms by Michael Hartley as he described on his [YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/iH0JMfR7BTI).

This is a _work in progress_.
